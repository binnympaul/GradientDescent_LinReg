# GradientDescent_LinReg

This notebook implements the Gradient descent algorithm to fit a linear regression model. Various machine learning techniques are explored as part of this exercise. A rough outline is as follows:

* Data Input
* EDA
* Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
  * Linear Regression Cost Function
  * Linear Regression Gradient Function
  * Gradient Descent Function
* Fitting Linear Regression Parameters
  * Learning Rate Tuning
  * Parameter Interpretation and Visualization
* Polynomial Regression
* Model Evaluation: Cross-validation

**Note**: The Notebook may not open on GitHub. Please download the files to explore. Thanks!
